                Sachin Tendulkar has been the most complete batsman of his time, the most prolific runmaker of all time, and arguably the biggest cricket icon the game has ever known. His batting was based on the purest principles: perfect balance, economy of movement, precision in stroke-making, and that intangible quality given only to geniuses - anticipation. If he didn't have u signature stroke - the upright, back-foot punch comes close - it's because he was equally proficient at each of the full range of orthodox shots and plenty of improvised ones as well. There were no apparent weaknesses in Tendulkar's game. He could score all around the wicket, off both front foot and back, could tune his technique to suit every condition, temper his game to suit every situation, and made runs in all parts of the world in all conditions.

                Some of his finest performances came against Australia, the overwhelmingly dominant team of his era. His century as a 19-year-old on a lightning-fast pitch at the WACA is considered one of the best innings ever to have been played in Australia. A few years later he received the ultimate compliment from the ultimate batsman: Don Bradman confided to his wife that Tendulkar reminded him of himself.

            <p class="paragraph1">
                Tendulkar set about doing become one of the best batsmen in the world. He was only 16 when he debut. He was hit on the mouth by Waqar Younis but continued to bat, in a blood-soaked shirt. His first Test match-saving one at Old Trafford, came when he was 17, and he had 16 Test hundreds before he turned 25. In 2000 he became the first batsman to have scored 50 international hundreds, in 2008 he passed Brian Lara as the leading scorer, and in the years after, he went past 13,000 Test runs 30,000 international runs, and 50 Test hundreds.
